# CurrencyConverter
This program converts the dollar currency with the rand currency, vice versa.
I used ($1 = R15) as the default comparison.
Reason:
R15 a dollar is usually the average price, or so it has been for the past year.
The dollar usually falls below R15 - then rise within the same week to above R15, every week (for this past year).
You can find the source code in the master branch.
